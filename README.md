Facing problems while uploading file using retrofit


### MY GOAL
 =============
* Get file from android
* Upload that file to server using retrofit
* Download File from server
* Save that file to the local storage




### Facing two main problems
1. Problem getting file using intent
   => Uri lacks 'file' scheme:

2. Uploading that file using retrofit

Also I need to download and save file using retrofit.
I am not sure if there would be a problem too.

It would be very grateful if you can help me with these problems
